# DNA-sequence-classification
Binary classification is done by using various supervised learning algorithms and best model found using cross validaion.

Each DNA sequence of string is first coverted into sequence of 57 necleotides , which then used as features in modeling.

Various algorithms used for building classifcation model and performed cross validation for each. I found that SVM with linear kernel performed best with accuracy score of 96% and avg F-1 score of 96%.
